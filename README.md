# unity-revamp

_What is this for?_
We are a bunch of people who call ourselves unity Patch Team, trying to fix minor annoyances with Unity. We'll also try to make Unity awesomer.

_Great, so what?_
Nothing else. Look around. Try things, but dont blame us if things break. Raise an issue and we'll sort it out. Forks are welcome.

_You mean this is under development?_
Yes and no. This will be under active development at any point of time. Use the branch stable if you need something reliable.
