# unity-revamp

_What is this for?_  
We are a bunch of people who call ourselves unity Patch Team, trying to fix minor annoyances with Unity. We'll also try to make Unity awesomer.

_Great, so what?_  
Nothing else. Look around. Try things, but dont blame us if things break. Raise an issue and we'll sort it out. Forks are welcome.

_You mean this is under development?_  
Yes and no. This is under active development.  
But we promise to keep all code in the branch stable working.

_Legal?_  
Feel free to copy the code and if possible, contribute. But dont claim whats not yours to be yours. We dont like that in the FOSS world.
